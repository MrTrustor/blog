# Biography

I am a Cloud Architect and DevOps engineer at [Oxalide](http://www.oxalide.com), a Parisian consulting & hosting company, leader in the media, SaaS and e-commerce markets. I also accept freelance missions.

Born in Lyon, France, I have always had a taste for mathematics and physics. This lead me to study computer science at the [Lyc√©e du Parc](https://lyceeduparc.fr/ldp/). At the [Ecole Centrale de Lyon](http://www.ec-lyon.fr/), this new taste for computer science allowed me to invest myself heavily in the student computer association [ECLAIR](http://www.eclair.ec-lyon.fr/) which serves, among other things, as an ISP for all students of the university. I finished my formal education at the Royal Institute of Technology of Sweden, also known as [KTH](http://www.kth.se/en), where I learned about cryptography, networks, and so many other things. Today, I still try to learn as much as I can on various topics such as Machine Learning or distributed systems.

My professional life began very much in accordance with the DevOps philosophy (even if I did not know it at the time) by designing the software development and CI workflow of the [ANSSI](http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/), following some extremely strict security rules. My next job, at Oxalide, allowed me to gain a very important insight on the Ops side of the industry. Managing major web infrastructures on a day-to-day basis convinced me of the importance of the quality of the work earlier in the software lifecycle.

Today, my job is to help you make the best software possible at every level:

 - by choosing the right software architecture (micro-services, here I come!),
 - by ensuring that this software is production-ready (tests, 12-factor apps, etc.),
 - by running this software on highly efficient and resilient infrastructures (GCP, AWS, Kubernetes, Swarm and OpenShift are my friends),
 - by making your life easier and letting you concentrate on what you do well: coding great apps!

# Business

Do not hesitate to [contact](#contact) me via e-mail or Twitter for business opportunities. Depending on your needs, I can accept the mission myself or redirect you to my employer ([Oxalide](http://www.oxalide.com)). In the second case, I will most likely work on your project.
