Two weeks ago, I gave a presentation at the 42<sup>nd</sup> Docker Paris Meetup about Rancher. Rancher is a Docker orchestrator and, as such, a competitor of Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. However, it has some other features that make it very interesting and not incompatible with Swarm or Kubernetes.

Here is the first part of the presentation:

* a general presentation of Rancher,
* a first demonstration: creating and scaling an Elasticsearch cluster in Rancher.

French subtitles are available on the video.
Useful links:

* Source code: https://github.com/MrTrustor/rancher-vagrant
* Instructions: https://github.com/MrTrustor/rancher-vagrant/blob/master/HANDSON.md

In the second part to come, you will learn how to create your own custom catalog (one of its nicest features) in Rancher and how to manage a Kubernetes cluster _via_ Rancher.

EDIT: The second part is available [here](/post/rancher-handson-part2/).
