I know it's a little bit late, but here are the videos (in French) of my talks at the Google Cloud
Paris Summit 2019 (which happened on June 18th, 2019).

The first is a demo of Anthos I gave during the keynote. My laptop failed to recognize the projector
when it woke up, which is why I talk without any demo for the first 3 minutes (which were the longest in my life!).

The second one is a session about Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) I gave, with a customer testimony.
