Here is the second part of the presentation I gave at the 42<sup>nd</sup> Docker Paris Meetup about Rancher. For the first video, [click here](/post/rancher-handson-part1/).
Three subjects are treated here:

* Demonstration of the Rancher catalog,
* Creating a custom catalog, updating an item,
* Creating a Kubernetes cluster with Rancher.

French subtitles are available on the video.
