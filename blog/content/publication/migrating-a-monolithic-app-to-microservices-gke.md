abstract = "This article guides you through the high-level concepts of migrating a website from a monolithic platform to a refactored, container-based microservices platform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The migration is done feature by feature, avoiding a large-scale migration event and its associated risks. This article is intended for IT professionals in charge of a complex website that's hosted on a monolithic platform and that they want to modernize. Reading this article does not require an in-depth knowledge of GCP or Kubernetes. The goal of a migration like this is to provide a more nimble and scalable environment for individual features of the site, where the features can be more easily managed and updated than if they are part of the monolithic platform. Running in such an environment leads to faster improvements on each migrated feature, providing users with value along the way. This article uses ecommerce websites as an example workload. Many ecommerce websites are built with monolithic and proprietary platforms, so they are good candidates for the migration described here. However, you can apply the principles described in this article to a wide range of workloads. You can benefit from the principles covered in this article as long as your systems and constraints are close enough to those described here. For example, websites for booking hotels or renting cars would also be good candidates for this migration pattern."
