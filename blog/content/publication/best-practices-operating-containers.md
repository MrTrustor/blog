abstract = "This article describes a set of best practices for making containers easier to operate. These practices cover a wide range of topics, from security to monitoring and logging. Their aim is to make applications easier to run in Kubernetes Engine and in containers in general. Many of the practices discussed here were inspired by the twelve-factor methodology, which is a great resource for building cloud-native applications. These best practices are not of equal importance. For example, you might successfully run a production workload without some of them, but others are fundamental. In particular, the importance of the security-related best practices is subjective. Whether you implement them depends on your environment and constraints. To get the most out of this article, you need some knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes. Some best practices discussed here also apply to Windows containers, but most assume that you are working with Linux containers"
