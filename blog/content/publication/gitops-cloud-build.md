abstract = "This article explains how to create a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on Google Cloud Platform using only hosted products and the popular GitOps methodology.
Google engineers have been storing configuration and deployment files in our primary source code repository for a long time. This methodology is described in the book Site Reliability Engineering, Chapter 8 (Beyer et. al., 2016), and was demonstrated by Kelsey Hightower during his Google Cloud Next '17 keynote. The term GitOps itself was coined by Weaveworks. A key part of GitOps is the idea of environments-as-code: describing your deployments declaratively using files (for example, Kubernetes manifests) stored in a Git repository.
In this tutorial, you create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds a container image from committed code, stores the image in Container Registry, updates a Kubernetes manifest in a Git repository, and deploys the application to Google Kubernetes Engine using that manifest."
